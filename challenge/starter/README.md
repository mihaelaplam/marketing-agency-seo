## Changes Made

In this project, I focused on improving the structure, semantics, and accessibility of the existing HTML document as well as the overall design. Here are the key modifications I made:

### HTML & CSS Modifications

1. **Semantic Tags:**
   - Replaced generic `<div>` tags with semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`, enhancing readability and structure.

2. **Nav Structure:**
   - Wrapped navigation items in a `<nav>` element for better semantic meaning.
   - Utilized `<ul>` for the menu items and `<li>` for individual menu items, creating a well-organized list structure.

3. **Image Accessibility:**
   - Added `alt` attributes to all `<img>` tags, ensuring enhanced accessibility for users with disabilities.

4. **Improved Headings:**
   - Updated the title element for a more descriptive and meaningful title.
   - Utilized appropriate heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`) to establish a clear document structure and improve accessibility.

5. **Class Refactoring:**
   - Consolidated repeated class names to enhance maintainability and consistency in styling.

6. **Class Refactoring:**
   - Changed the width of the side section so it matches with the rest
